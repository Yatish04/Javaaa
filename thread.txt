 if we have a complete class structure that already has a detailed inheritance tree and want it to run in its own thread, we cannot simply make this class structure inherit from the Thread class as we did before

 The Java language deals with this lack of multiple inheritance by using the mechanism known as interfaces


 runnable : 
 public interface Runnable {
     public abstract void run();
}

runnable contains only one function : run() ;
thread class impliments runnable interface;
