1. p =q+r ; concatenation of string 
2. k.substring(inital , final ) == [ initial , final )
3 . int m = Integer.parseInt(t.readLine());
4 . a number can be converted to string by appending null string 
5. each attribute has a get and set method for retrival and setting of object properties .
6.static operations and attributes are needed to invoke either a service of a class before any real instances of that class are instantiated or a service that does not directly apply to any of the instances .
7.String = final class , string objects are immutable 
8.String refrence can be overridden but that does not delete the content 
e.i h1 = " can" ; h2 = "can"; h3="can" ; multiple refrences can be used for same string but it will occur in the same place .
only one pool for string "can" is created with 3 refences .
STRING
1. arr.length();
2.arr.chatAt(8Of('char');
4.a.compareTo(b)  == (a-b) 
5.arr.contains(" " ) ;
6.arr.endsWith( " " );
7.arr.toLowerCase() ;
8.arr.toUpperCase();
