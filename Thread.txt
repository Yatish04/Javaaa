/* a thread is a single sequence of execution within a program 
multiple threading = multiple threads of control within a single program : each prgram can run multiple threads of control within it.
thread is a subset of process 
concurrency and parallelism: process and order of execution .
Thread share the address space of the process that created it .processes have their own address space.
application thread : when we execute a program: JVM creates a thread object whose task is defined by main method 
starts the method and stops when method returns | thread dies. 


MULtiple threads in an application : 
1.each thread has its private run-time stack 
2.if two threads execute the same method each has its own copy .
3.all thread see the same dynamic programming (heap)
4.two different threads can act on same object and same static feilds concurrently 


TWO ways to create our own thread object :
1.subclassing  the thread class and instantiating
2.implementing runnable interface 
in both cases run method should be implemented .


applications of java :
implement multimedia graphics 
develop animations
dev. video games 

objective is to reduce response time .
